        To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and
        make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time
        zone). Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab
        hosted repository/project. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if
        a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. Pull requests
        must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count. If
        a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line
        with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to
        participate. This year, the first 55,000 participants who successfully
        complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
